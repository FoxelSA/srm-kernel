## SRM - Standard Refinement Modules<br />Kernel modules

<p align="justify">
The standard refinement modules (SRM) are responsible of data processing engaged
in the standard data storage structure. In this way, they are also responsible
of maintaining the storage structure through the management of the data processing.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The standard refinement modules are said standard in the way the data processing
interface they offer is identical from a module to another, providing and simple
and standardized front-end to data processing and storage management.
</p>

<p align="justify">
This repository contains the kernel standard refinement module. The kernel
modules are responsible of the most fundamental processing steps of the data
coming out of the digitizing devices. In other word, they offer a data processing
interface that allows to obtain most important and fundamental refined data that
can be used by external modules to produce more refined and complex results.
